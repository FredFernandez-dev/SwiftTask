SWIFT TECHNICAL TASK README

INSTALLATION NOTES:

The technical task is included in a single .PHP file created using PHPStorm using PHP 7.4, it doesn’t require any particular installation guidelines. It should be able to run as a command line script with no issues. 

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Data validation is not 100% successful, it is possible to introduce four consecutive Roman numerals (for example IIII), and it will add them instead of throwing an error saying it’s not a valid Roman numeral. To fix in next version
